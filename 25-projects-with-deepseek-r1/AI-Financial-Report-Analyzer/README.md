# AI-Financial Report Analyzer

## Overview
The **AI-Financial Report Analyzer** is a Python-based application that leverages the DeepSeek AI model to analyze financial reports. It helps users extract key financial metrics, detect trends, and provide structured summaries of the financial data. The project includes two main components: an API service built with FastAPI and a web interface using Gradio. The AI model provides insights into financial reports to aid in decision-making and analysis.

## Features
- **Financial Insights:** Extracts key financial metrics such as revenue, profit, expenses, and debt.
- **Trend Detection:** Identifies trends in financial data such as revenue growth or expense patterns.
- **Report Summarization:** Provides a structured summary of the financial report.
- **Web Interface:** A simple Gradio interface to input financial reports and view the AI-generated insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn (for running the FastAPI app)
- Gradio
- Requests
- DeepSeek AI model

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/laithkh12/25-projects-with-deepseek-r1.git
cd 25-projects-with-deepseek-r1
```

### 2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the FastAPI app (API Service):
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
This will start the API server locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 4. Launch the Gradio web interface:
```bash
python financial_analyzer.py
```
The Gradio interface will open in your browser. You can now paste financial report data to receive insights.

## File Descriptions

### `app.py`
The FastAPI backend application that exposes a POST endpoint `/analyze_financials/` for analyzing financial reports. It sends the financial data to the DeepSeek AI model and returns the extracted insights and trends.

#### Key Components:
- FastAPI for handling API requests.
- Uses the `requests` library to communicate with the DeepSeek AI model.

### `financial_analyzer.py`
A script that creates a Gradio-based web interface for interacting with the AI model. Users can paste financial report data, and the application will generate insights and detect trends in the provided data.

#### Key Components:
- Uses the `requests` library to interact with the DeepSeek API.
- Gradio is used for creating the user interface.
- Provides insights into financial reports such as revenue, profit, and debt analysis.

## Usage

1. **API Usage (FastAPI):**
   - POST your financial report data to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze_financials/`.
   - Example payload:
     ```json
     {
       "report": "Company: ABC Inc, Revenue: $75M, Net Profit: $12M, Expenses: $50M, Debt: $10M"
     }
     ```
   - The response will contain the AI-generated insights and trends based on the financial report.

2. **Web Interface (Gradio):**
   - Paste your financial report data into the Gradio interface.
   - The app will display the extracted financial insights, trends, and structured summary generated by the AI model.

## Example

### Sample Financial Report:
"Company: ABC Inc, Revenue: $75M, Net Profit: $12M, Expenses: $50M, Debt: $10M"

### AI-Generated Insights:
- **Revenue:** $75M
- **Net Profit:** $12M
- **Expenses:** $50M
- **Debt:** $10M
- **Trend:** Positive net profit margin with moderate debt levels.
